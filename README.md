# Synthwave84-Dark
This is a darker edition of [robb0wen](https://github.com/robb0wen)'s [synthwave-vscode](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode). It uses the same syntax highlight colours but it has a black background instead of the original dark purple.

## Why does this exist?
I like themes with black backgrounds (maybe bad for my eyes) and I like [synthwave-vscode](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode) so I decided to put the two together and create this abomination. Nice.
