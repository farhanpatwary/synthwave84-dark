# Synthwave84-Dark
This is a darker edition of [robb0wen](https://github.com/robb0wen)'s [synthwave-vscode](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode). It uses the same syntax highlight colours but it has a black background instead of the original dark purple.

## Why does this exist?
I like the original [synthwave-vscode](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode) syntax colours but I have started to move towards darker themes, with a preference to themes with black backgrounds.    For that reason, I decided to take the colours of the original [synthwave-vscode](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode) and replace the dark purple background with a full black one.
